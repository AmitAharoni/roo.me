The demand for living in major cities is high and expensive.  
Most of the people in their early 20s and 30s, prefer to live with roommates.  
People are wasting their time searching unsuccessfully for roommate apartments, going through several platforms.

Finding great roommates to live with shouldnâ€™t be that hard.
